# ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

Unfortunately I am not quite done this project. I am tired, and will finish in the morning. For now  task 5 in the sba is the only thing not 100% done. I just have to write the logic for the controller for each of the routes and test them. Everything else as far as creating users and using local and OAuth verification to validate them is up and running.
